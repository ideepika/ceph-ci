>=14.2.1
--------

* Ceph now packages python bindings for python3.6 instead of
  python3.4, because EPEL7 recently switched from python3.4 to
  python3.6 as the native python3. see the `announcement <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/epel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EGUMKAIMPK2UD5VSHXM53BH2MBDGDWMO/>_`
  for more details on the background of this change.

* Nautilus-based librbd clients can now open images on Jewel clusters.

14.2.2
------

* The no{up,down,in,out} related commands has been revamped.
  There are now 2 ways to set the no{up,down,in,out} flags:
  the old 'ceph osd [un]set <flag>' command, which sets cluster-wide flags;
  and the new 'ceph osd [un]set-group <flags> <who>' command,
  which sets flags in batch at the granularity of any crush node,
  or device class.

* RGW: radosgw-admin introduces two subcommands that allow the
  managing of expire-stale objects that might be left behind after a
  bucket reshard in earlier versions of RGW. One subcommand lists such
  objects and the other deletes them. Read the troubleshooting section
  of the dynamic resharding docs for details.
