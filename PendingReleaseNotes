13.2.7
======

* The MDS cache trimming is now throttled. Dropping the MDS cache
  via the `ceph tell mds.<foo> cache drop` command or large reductions in the
  cache size will no longer cause service unavailability.

* The CephFS MDS behavior with recalling caps has been significantly improved
  to not attempt recalling too many caps at once, leading to instability.
  MDS with a large cache (64GB+) should be more stable.

* MDS now provides a config option "mds_max_caps_per_client" (default: 1M) to
  limit the number of caps a client session may hold. Long running client
  sessions with a large number of caps have been a source of instability in the
  MDS when all of these caps need to be processed during certain session
  events. It is recommended to not unnecessarily increase this value.

* The `cache drop` admin socket command has been removed. The `ceph tell mds.X
  cache drop` remains.

* RGW: radosgw-admin introduces two subcommands that allow the
  managing of expire-stale objects that might be left behind after a
  bucket reshard in earlier versions of RGW. One subcommand lists such
  objects and the other deletes them. Read the troubleshooting section
  of the dynamic resharding docs for details.
