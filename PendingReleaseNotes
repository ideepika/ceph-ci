>=13.2.0
========

(some or all of the notes in this section seem to have been omitted
from the 13.2.0 release notes (?), so include them in 13.2.1 release
notes (?))

* The Telegraf module for the Manager allows for sending statistics to
  an Telegraf Agent over TCP, UDP or a UNIX Socket. Telegraf can then
  send the statistics to databases like InfluxDB, ElasticSearch, Graphite
  and many more.

* The graylog fields naming the originator of a log event have
  changed: the string-form name is now included (e.g., ``"name":
  "mgr.foo"``), and the rank-form name is now in a nested section
  (e.g., ``"rank": {"type": "mgr", "num": 43243}``).

* If the cluster log is directed at syslog, the entries are now
  prefixed by both the string-form name and the rank-form name (e.g.,
  ``mgr.x mgr.12345 ...`` instead of just ``mgr.12345 ...``).

* The JSON output of the ``osd find`` command has replaced the ``ip``
  field with an ``addrs`` section to reflect that OSDs may bind to
  multiple addresses.

13.2.1
======

* CephFS clients without the 's' flag in their authentication capability
  string will no longer be able to create/delete snapshots. To allow
  ``client.foo`` to create/delete snapshots in the ``bar`` directory of
  filesystem ``cephfs_a``, use command:

    - ``ceph auth caps client.foo mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rw tag cephfs data=cephfs_a' mds 'allow rw, allow rws path=/bar'``

13.2.3
======

* The default memory utilization for the mons has been increased
  somewhat.  Rocksdb now uses 512 MB of RAM by default, which should
  be sufficient for small to medium-sized clusters; large clusters
  should tune this up.  Also, the ``mon_osd_cache_size`` has been
  increase from 10 OSDMaps to 500, which will translate to an
  additional 500 MB to 1 GB of RAM for large clusters, and much less
  for small clusters.

* Ceph v13.2.2 includes a wrong backport, which may cause mds to go into
  'damaged' state when upgrading Ceph cluster from previous version.
  The bug is fixed in v13.2.3. For ceph v13.2.2 installation, upgrading
  to v13.2.3 does not requires special action.

* The bluestore_cache_* options are no longer needed. They are replaced
  by osd_memory_target, defaulting to 4GB. BlueStore will expand
  and contract its cache to attempt to stay within this
  limit. Users upgrading should note this is a higher default
  than the previous bluestore_cache_size of 1GB, so OSDs using
  BlueStore will use more memory by default.
