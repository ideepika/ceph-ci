13.2.7
======

* The `cache drop` admin socket command has been removed. The `ceph tell mds.X
  cache drop` remains.

* RGW: radosgw-admin introduces two subcommands that allow the
  managing of expire-stale objects that might be left behind after a
  bucket reshard in earlier versions of RGW. One subcommand lists such
  objects and the other deletes them. Read the troubleshooting section
  of the dynamic resharding docs for details.
